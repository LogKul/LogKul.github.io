                    <h3>Social Implications</h3>
                    <p>It's quite obvious to see that from a social standpoint, tension has just been growing and
                        growing between the working class and the upper class. With the advent of social media,
                        information spreads like wildfire and so do emotions and argumentation. As social media has
                        grown and grown, so has online contention, which has bled into the real world. One way these
                        contentions have grown is due to the dissatisfaction of the working class, as people are
                        becoming increasingly more aware that they're not being compensated justly, and thus has led to
                        a recent mass drop of workers in industries all across America. It is a very common sentiment
                        that wages need to be higher and workers need more benefits in order to keep up with the
                        ever-growing cost-of-living. The wealthy have become a symbol of the economic oppression that
                        people across America have come to feel, as the working class believes it is unfair for a select
                        few group of people to have so much money, while a large majority of people are struggling.</p>

                    <h3>Political Implications</h3>
                    <p>The political implications of the wealth disparity are immense. As a result of the large gap in
                        monetary value between the working class and the upper class, political power tends to exist
                        solely in the hands of whoever has the money to buy off representatives. A lot of legislation is
                        passed and funded by major companies and corporations, purely in their own interets rather than
                        in the interests of the working class and the world. For example, Coca-Cola has put an immense
                        amount of money into dietary research in order to hide the fact that Coke and other sodas are
                        incredibly unhealthy and are one of the biggest factors to weight gain and the obesity pandemic
                        across America. However, rather that find healthier ways to make a tasty drink, they act in
                        their own interest and do their best to make the most money, at the expense of poor nation-wide
                        dietary health.</p>
