                    <p>The political implications of the wealth disparity are immense. As a result of the large gap in
                        monetary value between the working class and the upper class, political power tends to exist
                        solely in the hands of whoever has the money to buy off representatives. A lot of legislation is
                        passed and funded by major companies and corporations, purely in their own interets rather than
                        in the interests of the working class and the world. For example, Coca-Cola has put an immense
                        amount of money into dietary research in order to hide the fact that Coke and other sodas are
                        incredibly unhealthy and are one of the biggest factors to weight gain and the obesity pandemic
                        across America. However, rather that find healthier ways to make a tasty drink, they act in
                        their own interest and do their best to make the most money, at the expense of poor nation-wide
                        dietary health.</p>
