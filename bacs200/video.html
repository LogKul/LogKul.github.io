                    <p class="transcripttext">Hello, my name is Logan Kulesus, and I am currently a sophomore attending
                        UNC Greeley, and am
                        currently pursuing a Software Engineering Degree. I've always enjoyed working with
                        computers,
                        and I really think that software engineering is something I truly want to pursue. My five
                        greatest skills right now are my work ethic, motivation, programming, resourcefulness, and
                        my
                        dedication to my work. I work hard in my studies, and have had many semesters throughout
                        high
                        school and college with a 4.0 GPA. I plan on pursuing a career as a software engineer
                        sometime
                        in the near future after earning my degree.</p>
                    <p class="transcripttext">I would provide a lot for a prospective company, as I am knowledgeable in
                        a
                        wide variety of
                        computer science topics, and enjoy solving problems. I would be happy to work with other
                        people
                        to create software for a company, and I would love to dedicate myself to my work and make
                        sure
                        everything I create is top-notch. I would absolutely be a fantastic addition to any team,
                        and I
                        look forward to kickstarting my career! I'll provide some links below this video to
                        additional
                        resources that are related to my skillset and that I find interesting and educational.</p>
