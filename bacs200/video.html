                        <p>Hello, my name is Logan Kulesus, and I am currently a sophomore attending UNC Greeley, and am
                            currently pursuing a Software Engineering Degree. I've always enjoyed working with
                            computers,
                            and I really think that software engineering is something I truly want to pursue. My five
                            greatest skills right now are my work ethic, motivation, programming, resourcefulness, and
                            my
                            dedication to my work. I work hard in my studies, and have had many semesters throughout
                            high
                            school and college with a 4.0 GPA. I plan on pursuing a career as a software engineer
                            sometime
                            in the near future after earning my degree.</p>
                        <p>I would provide a lot for a prospective company, as I am knowledgable in a wide variety of
                            computer science topics, and enjoy solving problems. I would be happy to work with other
                            people
                            to create software for a company, and I would love to dedicate myself to my work and make
                            sure
                            everything I create is top-notch. I would absolutely be a fantastic addition to any team,
                            and I
                            look forward to kickstarting my career! I'll provide some links below this video to
                            additional
                            resources that are related to my skillset and that I find interesting and educational.</p>
