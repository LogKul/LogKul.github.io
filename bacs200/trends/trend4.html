                    <h2>Changes in The Economy</h2>
                    <br>
                    <hr>

                    <p>When the Covid-19 pandemic hit in March of 2020, the economy was hit pretty hard. Remote work was
                        mandated across a vast majority of office jobs, and employment dropped as many employers
                        couldn't afford to pay their employees. We have since been recovering from the economic hit, yet
                        are once again amidst a massive economic change, this time more caused by cultural uproar and
                        demand for change. Many people are frustrated at the disparity between the current
                        cost-of-living and the wages that majority of jobs provide, as working inhuman hours is
                        typically necessary to stay afloat, all while billionaires and mega-corporations are making the
                        most ludicrous profits that the world has seen in years.</p>
                    <p>This outrage materializes itself in a mass quitting, unoficially dubbed "The Great Resignation,"
                        as many workers across the USA are quitting their jobs because of low wages, lack of benefits,
                        poor working conditions, and overall low quality of life. This large-scale resignation has left
                        many jobs begging for employees, hiring at all positions, and increasing the scale of wages and
                        benefits to try to draw more employees back into the workforce. However, this resignation is
                        still ongoing, and the consequences are, as of now, unclear. It is possible that this may cuase
                        a large fluctuation in the workforce that the economy won't recover from for a while, but it's
                        possible that higher standards of living can be achieved through higher wages and benefits
                        becoming normalized in an effort to try to reclaim the resigners.</p>
