                    <h2>The Popularization of Investing</h2>
                    <br>
                    <hr>

                    <p>The investment world used to be very different before the development of worldwide networking
                        through the Internet, and the services that have grown since then. One example of this growing
                        technological accessibility is the existence of investment apps, with the most popular example
                        being Robinhood. With investment opportunities and capabilities sitting at the tips of our
                        fingers, investing has become a popular option for the common man. This has led to a more
                        "gamey" perspective of investment strategies, where the one and only goal is to make money the
                        fastest by any means necessary, rather than strategically investing in businesses with high
                        prospects. The biggest example of this in recent memory is the GameStop (GME) stock incident.
                        This incident involved members of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit (a subreddit is a community of
                        users with one similar interest) banding together to artificially inflate the value of
                        GameStop's stock, with the intention being to make large amounts of money by selling the stock
                        after it grows as well as intending to screw over stock shorters. Shorting a stock involves a
                        lender lending a stock to a short seller, who expects that stock to decrease in value. The short
                        seller then immediately sells the stock for a lump sum of money, and then buys back the stock
                        after the price drops in order to return the stocks to the lender. The users of r/WallStreetBets
                        see this as unethical gambling, and wanted to make all the short sellers of the GameStop stock
                        to have to pay much more than the original price that they sold for, and because they are
                        legally obligated to give the stocks back, they must buy the stocks back, even if they are much
                        more expensive than before. This forced buying back of the stocks initiates a short squeeze,
                        where the price increases further because of the larger amounts of transactions being performed
                        with the stock.</p>
                    <p>Another example of modern investment trends comes with the advent of cryptocurrency and
                        non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Cryptocurrencies are unregulated digital currencies that are made
                        possible using intensive hashing software. The real-world value of cryptocurrencies fluctuates
                        in the same way that stocks and similar investments do, so cryptocurrencies are treated as
                        investments more than as actual currency. NFTs fall under a similar category, as they are
                        digital items that are minted with a unique identifier than can be exchanged, that is a
                        "proof-of-ownership," despite not actually acting as legal ownership at the time of writing.
                        These NFTs tend to be treated as investments, although that would be putting it generously. They
                        are more often traded within a small group of people to artificially increase the value until a
                        genuine buyer believes that the NFt holds value, and buys it for an exhorbitant price, even
                        though the actual value of the NFT is likely much lower. These communities that "own" these NFTs
                        have been growing, and despite being very controversial, seems to be getting some attention from
                        serious investors.</p>
