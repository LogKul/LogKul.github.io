                    <h2>Emergence of Cancel Culture</h2>
                    <br>
                    <hr>

                    <p>From the very beginning, communication and socialization over the Internet has been notoriously
                        different in comparison to interacting with other people in real life. Whether you're emailing a
                        work colleague some important information in a formal matter or you are posting some
                        controversial opinions on Twitter through an anonymous account, we tend to behave differently on
                        the Internet, even if only slightly. However, the more popularized perspective of Internet
                        communications is the idea that annonymity and inconsequentialism go hand in hand in affecting
                        how we use the Internet differently, and not always for the better. Since the beginning, there
                        have always been people who used the Internet to troll, cyberbully, and harass others, all under
                        the guise of anonymity.</p>
                    <p>Cancel culture is a recently-dubbed means by which the masses, or majority of Internet users on a
                        platform, will hold individuals accountable through means such as excessive emphasis of the
                        individual's behavior, seeking out personal information on the individual, and attempting to
                        affect the real life of that individual behind the screen. Cancel culture is a controversial
                        topic, as many believe it is the best way to hodl individuals accountable and regulate Internet
                        behavior, while others see it as excessive, overexaggerated, and too harmful for the individuals
                        involved. The biggest flaw to cancel culture is how mob mentality can devolve into being the
                        loudest voice, despite conflicting factual information or lies made up about an individual.
                        Typically when a person is "cancelled," they may lose sponsorships, careers, future job
                        opportunities, and even close relationships, which can end up permanently affecting somebody's
                        life, which can result from a large enough group of people declaring that the actions somebody
                        has taken require that person to be cancelled. While cancel culture is one method to holding
                        Internet users accountable, I believe that it can be misused so easily that it can cause
                        permanent damage to somebody's life that I don't think that it should become the norm for
                        managing Internet behavior.</p>
