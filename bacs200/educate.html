                    Sage</strong></td>

            <td style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px">As humans, our perception of our limits tend to
                discourage us and subconsciously suggest that we can't
                succeed. Our subconscious tends to limit our conscious, so we need to align our conscious to cooperate
                with the subconscious. Our environments tend to win out over our desires and motivations. The solution
                to these issues is to make sure we put ourselves in suitable environments, and stop putting the wrong
                things into our minds and start putting the right things in our mind.</td>

            <td style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px">Grit is a better indicator of success than intelligence
                or social skills. Because of this, grit might be
                an important topic to educate kids with rather than running with the stereotypes that success is
                inherent and comes naturally to most successful people.</td>

            <td><cite>The Paradox of Choice</cite> by <strong>Professor Renata Salecl</strong></td>
            <td><iframe width="280" height="160" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bqMY82xzWo"
                    title="YouTube video player"

                    allowfullscreen></iframe></td>
            <td style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px">Choices can cause anxiety, even though we all want
                change. The perceptions of other people affect our actions, because we're self-conscious, which reduces
                the capacity for radical social change. Choice also requires a loss, which is why we try to mitigate
                loss as much of possible by trying to choose the "best" choice. The world has evolved into a place where
                people believe that they are in charge of their lives, even though they are trapped in a system of long
                work hours and consumption, and people tend to blame themselves for all failure, even if that is not so.
